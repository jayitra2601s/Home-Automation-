****# Home-Automation-

This project focuses on developing an advanced home automation system that utilizes an Arduino board and artificial intelligence for seamless control of home appliances through voice commands. Similar to Amazon Alexa, this system allows users to interact with their home environment by simply speaking to the AI. The main aim of building this project is to enhance privacy, control and manage data independently, tailor the system to our needs, and avoid third-party data transmission.

Key Features:

  • Voice-Activated Commands: Users can control various home appliances by issuing voice commands to the AI.
  
  • Personalized AI Assistant: The system allows for custom naming of the AI assistant, enhancing user experience and personalization.
  
  • Integration of Python and Arduino: The project leverages the power of Python for AI functionalities and Arduino coding for hardware control, ensuring a robust and efficient automation system.
  
  • User-Friendly Interface: Designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making home automation accessible to everyone.

By combining cutting-edge AI technology with reliable Arduino hardware, this project aims to bring the convenience of smart home automation to a broader audience.


# How to use ?

Install python on your windows and install all the python modeules mentioned in the "Modules.txt" file. Connect the Aruino board with your PC and all the connections according to the diagram and run the "Main.py" file only and enjoy your own home assistant.

•This is the first screen when we open the application. It takes input from the user i.e. username his/her gender and the botname that he/she wants to give his assistant name.
